# Procedure for Investigating and Removing Members Due to Incompetence

1. Definition of Incompetence:

    Incompetence is defined as a significant and persistent inability of a member to effectively fulfill their duties and responsibilities within their respective house,  grassroots DAO or Community . This includes, but is not limited to, consistent failure to contribute to the house's goals and objectives, inability to meet established performance standards, or repeated neglect of their responsibilities.

2. Reporting and Initiation:
    * The process begins with the submission of a formal complaint or report from any member of the Community to the Transparency Commission. Complaints should clearly outline the specific instances of incompetence.  \

3. Initial Review:
    * Upon receiving a complaint, the TC will conduct an initial review to determine its validity. This review should ascertain whether the complaint is based on reasonable grounds and falls within the scope of incompetence as defined. \

4. Notification:
    * If the complaint is deemed valid, the TC will notify the member in question, the house in which they serve, and the broader grassroots DAO community about the initiation of an investigation. Transparency and clear communication are key. \

5. Investigation Process:
    * The TC will conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations of incompetence. This may include collecting evidence, interviewing relevant parties, and assessing the member's performance within the house. The investigation should be impartial and objective.

6. Fair Hearing:
    * The member in question will be given an opportunity to provide their side of the story, present evidence, and address the allegations. They should also have the right to be represented by counsel or an advocate. (Do we have an advocate for TC/NDC) \

## 7. Determination of Incompetence:

    * Based on the findings of the investigation and the member's response, the TC will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the claim of incompetence. This determination should be made based on a preponderance of evidence. \

2. 8. Potential Remedies:
    * If incompetence is established, the TC will consider appropriate remedies, which may include but are not limited to:
        * Offering performance improvement plans.
        * Providing mentoring or support to help the member meet their responsibilities.
        * Recommending a temporary leave of absence.
        * Recommending the removal of the member from their role within the house.
3. 9. Appeal Process:
    * The member in question has the right to appeal the TC's determination and recommended remedies. An appeal process should be clearly defined, ensuring a fair and unbiased review of the decision. \

4. 10. Removal Decision:
    * If, after the appeal process (if applicable), the TC determines that removal is the appropriate remedy, the TC will communicate this decision to the house in question and the broader grassroots DAO community. The house will then follow its internal procedures for removal, which may include a community vote. There is no procedure on it. HOM can reject funding for particular DAO \

5. 11. Transparent Communication:
    * Throughout the entire process, the TC will communicate its findings, determinations, and recommendations transparently to the community, ensuring that the process remains open and accountable. \

6. 12. Confidentiality:
    * While the investigation is ongoing, the TC will take measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of all parties involved. However, the results and actions taken should be transparently communicated to the community.

# Guidelines for Investigating and Addressing Incompetence

## Type 1: Consistent Failure to Contribute

* Failure to meet deadlines or fulfill assigned tasks.
* Lack of engagement in discussions and decision-making processes.


### Test for Incompetence:

1. Does the member frequently miss house meetings, working group sessions, or other essential gatherings?
2. Are there instances of the member consistently failing to meet deadlines or fulfill assigned tasks?
3. Does the member display a lack of engagement in discussions and decision-making processes?
4. Do the member's actions consistently fall short of their responsibilities, negatively impacting the house's progress?

## Type 2: Inability to Meet Performance Standards

### Indicators of Incompetence:

* Consistent subpar quality of work or outputs.
* Frequent revisions or corrections required.
* Failure to achieve key performance metrics and objectives.

### Test for Incompetence:

Evaluate the member's performance against the defined standards and metrics for their role. Assess whether their consistent failure to meet these benchmarks is negatively affecting the house's progress.

## Type 3: Repeated Neglect of Responsibilities
