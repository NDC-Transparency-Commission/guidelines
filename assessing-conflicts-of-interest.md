# Guidelines for Assessment of Disclosures Conflict of Interest

# **Overview**

1. Nature of the Conflict:
    * The TC assesses the nature of the conflict, considering whether it involves personal, financial, or other interests that may compromise impartial decision-making.
2. Severity and Potential Impact:
    * Conflicts are categorized based on their severity and potential impact on NDC activities. These categories may include low, medium, and high:
        * **Low:** When there is a perception of a conflict, even if it may not be irregular. This category focuses on avoiding any negative optics that may cast doubt on the member's actions or others involved.
        * **Medium:** When there is a potential issue with decision-making impartiality. It signifies a higher degree of concern about the impact of the conflict.
        * **High:** Reserved for conflicts that pose a significant risk, such as the misappropriation of funds, abuse of power, or a severe breach of integrity.
3. Transparency and Trust Impact:
    * The TC considers the potential impact of the conflict on the transparency and trustworthiness of NDC operations. Conflicts that could erode the trust of the community or compromise transparency are taken seriously.
4. Mitigation Efforts:
    * The TC evaluates whether the member has made sincere efforts to mitigate the conflict. This may include recusal, conflict management plans, or other actions to minimize the impact of the conflict on decision-making.
5. Community and Ecosystem Well-being:
    * The TC assesses how the conflict may affect the well-being of the broader community and the NDC ecosystem. Decisions should align with the best interests of these stakeholders.
6. Historical Context:
    * The TC may consider any relevant historical context or prior instances of conflicts involving the same member or within the NDC. This helps ensure consistent decision-making.
7. Compliance with Policies:
    * The TC evaluates whether the member's actions comply with NDC policies, guidelines, and conflict of interest rules. Non-compliance may be a factor in assessing the conflict's severity.
8. Public Perception and Reputation:
    * The TC considers how the conflict may be perceived by the public and how it may affect the reputation of the NDC and its associated bodies.
9. Community Feedback:
    * The TC may take into account feedback and concerns expressed by the broader NDC community and stakeholders regarding the disclosed conflict.
10. Recurrence Risk:
    * The TC assesses whether the conflict is an isolated incident or if there is a risk of its recurrence. This consideration helps in determining whether ongoing vigilance is required.

# **Nature of the Conflict**

The TC assesses the nature of the conflict, considering whether it involves personal, financial, or other interests that may compromise impartial decision-making. Types of conflict and ways to identify them:

**1. Financial Interests:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member is a major shareholder in a blockchain company that is applying for a substantial grant from the NDC.
* _Indicators:_
    * Direct financial gain or loss based on decisions.
    * Ownership of shares, stocks, or financial investments related to NDC activities.

**2. Personal Relationships:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member is a close friend or family member of an applicant seeking NDC funding.
* _Indicators:_
    * Personal connections with individuals or entities involved.
    * Emotional ties or close relationships that may influence decisions.

**3. Multiple Roles within the Ecosystem:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member holds positions in both the NDC and a related DAO, influencing decisions that affect both entities.
* _Indicators:_
    * Simultaneous roles or affiliations with entities making decisions.
    * Overlapping responsibilities or influence in various capacities.

**4. Hierarchical Working Relationships:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member holds a supervisory position in their primary role, potentially affecting subordinates' voting or decision-making.
* _Indicators:_
    * Authority or power imbalances in external roles.
    * Influence over individuals who have voting authority.

**5. Personal Benefit from Funding:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member's project is seeking funding, and they may personally benefit from the grant.
* _Indicators:_
    * Direct personal gain or benefit from the funding.
    * Clear alignment between personal interests and NDC decisions.

**6. Favoring Pre-Existing Relationships:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member has a long-standing business partnership with a vendor applying for a contract.
* _Indicators:_
    * Pre-existing relationships with applicants or vendors.
    * A history of collaboration that may bias decision-making.

## **Test for Identifying Conflicts:**

While there isn't a one-size-fits-all test, some questions can help identify conflicts of interest:

1. **Is there a potential for personal gain or loss based on the decision?**
    * Assess whether the individual may directly benefit from the outcome.
2. **Are there close personal relationships or affiliations that could influence judgment?**
    * Consider the presence of personal connections that could sway decision-making.
3. **Do the individual's roles or affiliations overlap or potentially create power imbalances?**
    * Examine whether simultaneous roles may affect impartiality.
4. **Is there a history of collaboration or partnership with entities involved in the decision?**
    * Review past interactions that might influence the current decision.
5. **Could the decision affect the community, ecosystem, or organization negatively due to the conflict?**
    * Consider the potential harm or erosion of trust in the community.

Ultimately, assessing conflicts of interest involves a case-by-case analysis, considering both the individual's affiliations and the potential impact on the NDC. The goal is to maintain transparency and protect the best interests of the NDC and its community.

# **Severity and Potential Impact**

Conflicts are categorized based on their severity and potential impact on NDC activities. These categories may include low, medium, and high:

**1. Low Severity:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member is involved in a blockchain project as an advisor, and the project is applying for a small grant from the NDC. The member discloses this involvement.
* _Indicators for Low Severity:_
    * The conflict does not create a significant personal benefit or loss.
    * The potential impact on NDC activities is minimal.
    * The disclosure is made early and is transparent.

**2. Medium Severity:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member is a significant shareholder in a blockchain company applying for a substantial grant. While the member recusedrecuses themselves, there's a perception of influence due to their ownership.
* _Indicators for Medium Severity:_
    * The conflict has the potential to affect the outcome significantly.
    * There may be a perception that the member could influence the decision.
    * Recusal or conflict management is needed to ensure impartiality.

**3. High Severity:**

* _Example:_ An NDC member, who also works in a leadership role in a DAO, pushes for a grant application from their DAO without disclosure. The grant, if approved, would substantially benefit the DAO, and there is a lack of transparency in the process.
* _Indicators for High Severity:_
    * The conflict has a substantial financial impact on the NDC or ecosystem.
    * There is a lack of transparency or disclosure regarding the conflict.
    * There is a significant risk of corruption, misappropriation, or abuse of power.

## **Test for Determining Severity:**

To determine the severity of a conflict of interest, consider the following factors:

1. **Impact on Decision Outcome:**
    * Does the conflict have the potential to significantly influence the decision, potentially leading to personal gain or detriment?
2. **Perception of Influence:**
    * Is there a reasonable perception that the individual's conflict could influence the decision, even if their intent is to act impartially?
3. **Transparency and Disclosure:**
    * Has the conflict been disclosed transparently, or is there a lack of transparency, which could exacerbate concerns?
4. **Risk of Corruption or Abuse:**
    * Is there a substantial risk that the conflict could lead to corruption, misappropriation of funds, or an abuse of power?
5. **Overall Impact on the NDC and Community Trust:**
    * Consider the broader implications of the conflict on the NDC's activities, transparency, and the trust of the community.

By evaluating these factors, you can assess the severity of a conflict of interest and determine whether it falls into the low, medium, or high category. The goal is to ensure that conflicts are managed appropriately and with the best interests of the NDC and its community in mind.

# **Transparency & Trust Impact**

**Example 1 - Breach, Damages Trust**

* An NDC member has a close personal relationship with an applicant for NDC funding. The member actively lobbies for the approval of the funding, but the relationship is not disclosed until later.

**Indicators:**

* Lack of disclosure or delayed disclosure of a conflict.
* Omission of information that could be perceived as influencing the decision.
* Potential for community members or stakeholders to become aware of the conflict through other channels.

**Example 2 - No breach:**

* An NDC member is involved in a project applying for funding but decides to recuse themselves from the voting process and is transparent about the reason for their recusal.

**Indicators:**

* Timely and transparent recusal from decision-making.
* Clear communication regarding the reason for recusal and the steps taken to maintain transparency and impartiality.

## **Test for Transparency and Trust Impact:**

* **Timely Disclosure:** Did the member disclose the conflict promptly, allowing the TC to consider the conflict before a decision was made? The test assesses whether transparency was prioritized.
* **Potential for Perception:** Could the conflict, as perceived by the community or other stakeholders, damage the trust or reputation of the NDC? Consider how the conflict may be viewed by those unaware of the disclosure.
* **Actions Taken to Rebuild Trust:** If a lack of transparency was initially an issue, has the member taken subsequent actions to rebuild trust, such as public acknowledgment and remedial actions to mitigate the impact of the conflict?
* **Open Communication:** Did the member communicate their recusal in a transparent manner, providing a clear reason for their action? Transparency in the recusal process is essential for community trust.
* **Stakeholder Perception:** How are the recusal and transparency perceived by the broader community and stakeholders? Is there a general sense of trust and understanding regarding the member's actions?
* **Adherence to Ethical Standards:** Does the member's conduct align with established ethical standards and guidelines for addressing conflicts of interest? The test assesses whether the individual's actions contribute to a culture of transparency and trust.
* **Complete and Transparent Recusal:** Did the member fully and transparently recuse themselves from the decision-making process, without any attempt to exert influence? A complete recusal is essential for trust.
* **Consistency in Actions:** Has the member consistently adhered to ethical standards by avoiding any actions that could erode trust, such as lobbying for the project in question?
* **Community Feedback:** How has the NDC community responded to the member's actions? Positive community feedback can be an indicator of trust restoration.

In evaluating conflicts of interest regarding transparency and trust impact, the key is to consider the timing of disclosure or recusal, the perceived impact on trust, and the actions taken to maintain transparency and impartiality. The goal is to prioritize transparency and uphold community trust.

# **Mitigation Efforts**

**Example:**

* An NDC member is involved in a personal relationship with an applicant for NDC funding. To mitigate the conflict, the member actively seeks guidance from the Transparency Commission (TC) on how to maintain impartiality and transparency.

**Indicators:**

* Proactive engagement with the TC for guidance and advice on conflict mitigation.
* Willingness to learn and implement strategies to manage the conflict effectively.

## **Test for Mitigation Efforts:**

* **Proactive Engagement:** Did the member proactively seek guidance and advice from the TC or relevant authorities on how to manage the conflict? Proactive engagement indicates a commitment to mitigation.
* **Implementation of Guidance:** Has the member followed the advice and guidance provided to ensure impartiality and transparency? The test assesses the member's willingness to learn and act on recommendations.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Is the member open to continuous improvement and learning regarding conflict mitigation strategies? A commitment to ongoing mitigation efforts is a positive sign.

Community and NDC Wellbeing

# **Community and Ecosystem Well-being**

**Example:**

* An NDC member, who also works as an advisor to a blockchain project, lobbies for a significant grant for the project without disclosing the advisory role. The project is granted the funds, which later results in a financial loss for the NDC in the form of wasted funds and no tangible returns.

**Indicators:**

* A conflict that leads to a decision that has a direct, negative financial impact on the NDC.
* A lack of disclosure or transparency regarding the conflict.

## **Test for Community and Ecosystem Well-being:**

* **Impact on NDC Well-being:** Did the conflict result in a decision that had a significant negative impact on the NDC? The test assesses the tangible effect on the NDC's well-being, this can include tangible financial losses, damaging NEAR reputation and community morale, among others.
* **Transparency and Disclosure:** Was there a lack of disclosure or transparency regarding the conflict that contributed to the negative outcome? The test considers the role of transparency in decision-making.
* **Alignment with Best Interests:** Did the decision align with the best interests of the NDC and the broader ecosystem, or did it prioritize personal interests? This test evaluates the alignment of the decision with stakeholder well-being.

## **Factors for Removal**

There may be instances where ensuring the well-being of the community and ecosystem is reason enough to remove someone from their role as the only way to avoid conflicts of interest. Here are some circumstances where this might be warranted and considerations regarding the threshold for recusal:

1. **Adverse Impact on Well-being:** If a member's actions consistently lead to decisions that are detrimental to the well-being of the community or broader ecosystem, and this impact is clear and substantial, it can be a strong reason for removal. For example, decisions that divert resources away from community benefit or hinder ecosystem growth.
2. **Risk to the Ecosystem:** When the member's conflicts of interest pose a significant risk to the health, stability, or credibility of the ecosystem, and this risk is well-documented and substantial, it may justify removal to protect the ecosystem's integrity.
3. **Loss of Trust and Reputation:** If the community's trust in the organization or the broader ecosystem is significantly eroded due to perceived conflicts of interest and the resulting decisions, it can be a compelling reason for removal. A negative impact on the reputation of the ecosystem is an important consideration.
4. **Threshold for Recusal:** The threshold for recusal may be reached when a member's conflicts consistently jeopardize the well-being of the community and ecosystem. If their continued engagement creates a clear and significant risk to these interests, it may become untenable for them to continue in their role.

# **Historical Context**

The TC acknowledges that prior to the NDC coming into existence in October 2023, current and future NDC members may have held roles and responsibilities that were subject to conflicts of interest. How these previous roles were handled, as well as any historical conflicts of interest, can be considered by the TC in making determinations going forward.

## **Test Historical Context**

* **Impact of Previous Conflict:** How did the prior conflict affect the institutions reputation or operations? Understanding the historical consequences is crucial.
* **Learning from Past Roles:** Has the member demonstrated a commitment to learning from their past roles within Grassroots DAOs or the GWG, particularly when conflicts of interest arose? Learning and growth are key indicators of a proactive approach to conflict management.
* **Transparency in Past Decisions:** Did the member ensure transparency in past grant allocation decisions when conflicts of interest were present, and were they willing to disclose their affiliations or recuse themselves? Transparency and openness are essential indicators.
* **Preventive Measures:** Is there evidence that the member has taken preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of conflicts of interest based on their past experiences? Preventive actions show a commitment to proactive conflict management.

## **Factors Removal**

Historical context can be a valuable consideration in managing conflicts of interest, and there may be instances where it's relevant to remove someone from their role as the only way to avoid conflicts. Here are some circumstances where historical context might be a factor in removal and considerations regarding the threshold for recusal:

1. **Recurring Past Conflicts:** If an individual has a history of recurring conflicts of interest in previous roles or within the same organization, and these conflicts have been inadequately managed or resolved, it can raise concerns about their ability to effectively avoid conflicts in the future.
2. **Loss of Trust Over Time:** Over time, if a member's historical context indicates a consistent pattern of conflicts or a failure to address past issues, it can erode trust and credibility. This loss of trust within the organization or community may become a compelling reason for removal.
3. **Impact on Organizational Goals:** Historical context may reveal that the member's past conflicts have consistently resulted in decisions that are not aligned with the organization's goals and values. If the historical context indicates a pattern of decisions contrary to the best interests of the organization or community, it can be a strong factor for removal.
4. **Threshold for Recusal:** The threshold for recusal may be reached when a member's historical context demonstrates a consistent pattern of conflicts over time, which undermines the organization's ability to maintain transparency, fairness, and integrity in decision-making.

# **Compliance with Policies**

**Example 1 - non-compliance of Disclosure of Conflict of Interest policy:**

* An NDC member serves as a Council Member in a Grassroots DAO and fails to disclose their affiliation with the DAO when participating in grant decisions. The NDC has clear policies that require members to disclose any affiliations that may present conflicts of interest.

**Indicators:**

* Failure to disclose affiliations as required by NDC policies.
* Participation in grant decisions without transparently disclosing affiliations.

**Example 2 -**

* An NDC member, who previously contributed to the Governance Working Group (GWG), participates in a decision that benefits a project closely associated with the GWG without disclosing their prior involvement. The NDC has clear policies regarding disclosure of prior affiliations.

**Indicators:**

* Lack of disclosure regarding prior contributions to the GWG when participating in decisions.
* Participation in decisions that benefit projects associated with past affiliations without transparency.

## **Test for Compliance with Policies:**

* **Timely Disclosure:** Did the member make timely and transparent disclosures as required by NDC policies when affiliations presented potential conflicts of interest? Timeliness is a critical indicator of compliance.
* **Understanding of Disclosure Requirements:** Was the member fully aware of the NDC's disclosure requirements regarding affiliations and conflicts of interest? Understanding the requirements is essential for compliance.
* **Transparency and Accountability:** How did the member address the failure to comply with disclosure policies? The test evaluates the member's willingness to be transparent and accountable.

## **Removal for Breach of Compliance with Policies**

Compliance with policies and guidelines is a critical aspect of managing conflicts of interest within an organization. There may be instances where a member's repeated non-compliance with established policies could lead to their removal from their role as the only way to avoid conflicts of interest. Here are some circumstances where this might be warranted and considerations regarding the threshold for recusal:

1. **Consistent Policy Violations:** If a member repeatedly violates established policies and guidelines related to conflicts of interest, despite being aware of these policies, it may raise concerns about their willingness or ability to adhere to organizational standards.
2. **Impact on Decision-Making:** Non-compliance with policies and guidelines can significantly impact the fairness and integrity of decision-making processes. If a member's actions consistently result in decisions that are not aligned with the best interests of the organization or community due to policy violations, it can be a strong factor for removal.
3. **Lack of Effort to Remedy Non-Compliance:** If the member makes no or insufficient effort to correct their non-compliance or continues to violate policies after previous instances have been addressed, it may indicate an unwillingness to align with organizational standards.
4. **Threshold for Recusal:** The threshold for recusal may be reached when a member's non-compliance with policies and guidelines becomes so pervasive that it undermines the organization's ability to maintain transparency, fairness, and integrity in decision-making.

# **Public Perception and Reputation**

**Example:**

* An NDC member participates in a decision that benefits a project they are personally involved in, and this conflict of interest becomes widely known in the community, leading to negative public perception and criticism.

**Indicators:**

* Widespread awareness of the conflict and its impact on public perception.
* Negative public commentary, criticism, or loss of trust in the NDC and its associated bodies.

**Test for Public Perception and Reputation:**

* **Transparency and Accountability:** Did the member take proactive measures to address the conflict and maintain transparency when it became public knowledge? Transparency and accountability are critical in mitigating the impact.
* **Community Feedback:** What is the feedback from the community and stakeholders regarding the conflict and its impact on public perception? Community feedback provides insights into the severity of the situation.
* **Efforts to Rebuild Trust:** Did the member make efforts to rebuild trust and repair the reputation of the NDC and associated bodies following the negative public perception? Efforts to rebuild trust are important indicators.
# **Community Feedback**

**Example**:

* An NDC member simultaneously holds the role of a Council Member in a Grassroots DAO, and an active member within the NDC. The community perceives that this member's multifaceted involvement allows them to exert substantial influence over others' decisions in these bodies. Even with appropriate disclosures in place, concerns are raised within the community about the potential for conflicts of interest.

**Indicators:**

* Frequent and recurring concerns raised by multiple community members.
* The subject matter of the feedback directly relates to the integrity and transparency of decision-making processes.
* Respected and senior community members, as well as identifiable sources, voice concerns about the perceived influence of the member holding multiple roles.
  
## **Test for Community Feedback:**

* **Frequency of Feedback:** The TC will assess the frequency and recurrence of community feedback regarding the disclosed conflict of interest. A higher frequency of feedback may indicate a more significant community concern.
* **Importance of the Subject Matter:** The TC will evaluate the importance and criticality of the subject matter of the feedback. Matters directly related to the integrity of NDC operations, transparency, and fairness will be given greater weight.
* **Source of Feedback:** The TC will consider the source of the feedback. Feedback from highly respected and senior community members, as well as identifiable sources, may carry additional weight in the evaluation process. However, the TC will also consider the merits of anonymous feedback if it aligns with critical concerns.

## **Removal - Community Feedback**

Community feedback can play a significant role in determining whether someone should be removed from their role to avoid conflicts of interest. However, the threshold for removal based on community feedback may vary depending on the specific circumstances. Here are some instances where community feedback might be sufficient for removal and considerations regarding the threshold for recusal:

1. **Loss of Trust and Credibility:** If there is a consistent and substantial loss of trust and credibility in the member due to conflicts of interest, as indicated by widespread community feedback, it could be a compelling reason for removal.
2. **Impact on the NDC's Mission:** When community feedback highlights that the member's conflicts of interest consistently lead to decisions that are not aligned with the best interests of the NDC or the community, it raises concerns about their ability to fulfill their role.
3. **Violations of Policies and Guidelines:** If the member repeatedly violates established NDC policies and guidelines for managing conflicts of interest, and this is consistently pointed out in community feedback, it may justify removal.
4. **Lack of Response to Feedback:** The member's lack of response or failure to address concerns raised by the community in their feedback can be a significant factor. Ignoring or dismissing community feedback may indicate an inability to adapt and mitigate conflicts.
5. **Threshold for Recusal:** The threshold for recusal may be reached when a member's conflicts of interest are consistently so pervasive that they can no longer effectively participate in decisions without causing concerns or conflicts. This threshold may vary based on the organization's policies and the severity of the conflicts.

# **Recurrence Risk**

Recurring conflicts of interest can reach a point where they may necessitate removing someone from their role to avoid them. While there may not be a universally fixed threshold, a few scenarios and considerations where removing a member could be necessary due to recurring conflicts of interest include:

1. **Systemic and Ongoing Pattern:** If a member consistently faces recurring conflicts of interest across various decisions, it may indicate a systemic pattern rather than isolated incidents. When these conflicts continue over an extended period and are not effectively mitigated, it can erode trust in the decision-making process.
2. **Significant Impact on Decision-Making:** When the recurring conflicts consistently lead to decisions that are not aligned with the best interests of the NDC or the community, it becomes a serious concern. The impact of these conflicts on the NDC's mission and transparency is a critical factor.
3. **Community Loss of Trust:** If community feedback and concerns regarding the recurring conflicts indicate a loss of trust in the member's ability to act impartially and in the community's best interests, it becomes a compelling reason for reevaluation.
4. **Failure of Recusal and Mitigation Measures:** If the member's recusal and mitigation efforts have repeatedly proven ineffective in preventing recurring conflicts, this suggests that the member may be unable to adequately manage these conflicts.
5. **Policies and Guidelines:** It's crucial to consider whether the NDC has established clear policies and guidelines for managing conflicts of interest. If the member consistently violates or fails to adhere to these policies despite recurring conflicts, it may justify their removal.
